# Autonomous UAV 


The goal of this project is to control the autonomous navigation of an underwater vehicle, making use of the equations that describe its atitude and position and implement a software and simulation environment that allows to test and compare the performace  against a Machine learning algorithm added in the control system.

## Software Implementation: Matlab/Octave
---
As an initial approach to simulate the drone navigation, the softwares Octave or Matlab have been utilized to provide trajectories and compute the equations of the state-space model. Due to the high non-linearities of the plant, a novel control method is yet to be tested and possibly compared against traditional control algorithms.
